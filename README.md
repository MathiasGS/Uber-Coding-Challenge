# Uber Coding Challenge: Email Service

This project is for an Uber interview. It implements the Email Service challenge outlined in https://github.com/uber/coding-challenge-tools/blob/master/coding_challenge.md.

I have chosen the fullstack track in order to show off both frontend and backend experience.

The project is hosted on Azure: http://ubercodingchallenge.azurewebsites.net.

## Design Decisions

The challenge is loosely specified, hence I have made some essential design decissions/technical tradeoffs based on my own ideas of how the service should behave:

- Reliability over latency.

# Technology Stack

- Backend: Node.js and TypeScript.
- Frontend: Polymer.
- Storage: Azure Table Storage.

## Reasoning

# Further Work

Due to timing constraints, some areas of the service are not fully developed. Below is an outline of some of the areas of further work I had in mind when designing and implementing the service.

## Scalability

## Telemetry
